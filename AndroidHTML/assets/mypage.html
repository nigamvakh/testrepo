			<p><u>Slow Gardening, A No-Stress Philosophy for All Senses and Seasons</u><br /> by Felder Rushing</p>
			<p>Pasting a label in the middle of the wonderful Felder Rushings forehead poses a challenge. And his latest book doesnt help a bit.</p>
			<p>Does the label need to read horticultural expert? Homespun philosopher? Whimsical folk artist? All around cultural observer and commentator, down-home style?</p>
			<p>All would fit, the choice would be a challenge, but in <u>Slow Gardening</u>, the reader gets it all in one intriguing package.</p>
			<p>Taking off from the Left Coast concept of slow food pioneered by iconic chef and restaurateur Alice Waters, Felder invites us to take a look at how and why we garden, how we can do it better and have more fun at it, and how we can continuously learn from each other. I couldnt put this enchanting and enriching little book down!</p>
			Felder is truly one-of-a-kind: Arbor Gate friends take one look at his battered old pick-up truck parked nearby, the one with the traveling garden in the back of it, to know that here is a rare bird indeed.</p>
			<p>But whether listening or reading, one cannot help but learn something--not only about the science of growing things and the personal riches to be gained by getting our hands dirty, but about the benefits to our communities by getting outdoors and looking around with an open mind at whatever comes our way.
			Never hurts to have a laugh at the same time, though, and there are laughs a-plenty in this rich and colorful book.</p>
			<p>Thanks, Felder!</p>
